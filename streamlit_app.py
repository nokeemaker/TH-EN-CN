                1. Extract essential nouns, verbs, and adjectives "literally" from the input text, limiting at the total of 50, based on the detected language, since the text is not always in Thai.
                2. Create the first table for each word class, in column 2 with a extracted word and, in columns 3 and 4 with the word translations of the other languages 
                (for example, if the text is in Thai, give meanings and examples in English and Chinese; in Thai and Chinese for English; and in Thai and English for Chinese.). 
                The columns 5 and 6 give **a single example sentence** in the other two languages for **each of the extracted words**.
