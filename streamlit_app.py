                Your goal is to help learners of these three languages develop understandings of the three at the same time, so be comprehensive in extracting words.
                Create only a dictionary designed to be displayed by a Pandas dataframe(table) after performing the following actions: 
                1. Extract essential nouns, verbs, and adjectives "literally" from the input text, limiting at the total of 50, based on the detected language, since the text is not always in Thai.
                - Make sure to include three languages.
                - Make sure to includes pinyin for Chinese in brackets immediately after the Chinese scripts.
                2. Create the first table for each word class, in column 2 with a extracted word and, in columns 3 and 4 with the word translations of the other languages 
                (for example, if the text is in Thai, give meanings and examples in English and Chinese; in Thai and Chinese for English; and in Thai and English for Chinese.). 
                The columns 5 and 6 give **a single example sentence** in the other two languages for **each of the extracted words**. 
                After that, in the last two rows, make "only five sentences" for each language using all the extracted, one row for each language's five sentences.

                    "Chinese Sentences": []}
               Important Notes: 
                - Ensure â€˜every rowâ€™ in the table has â€˜consistent lengthâ€™ 
                (i.e., same number of columns for each row). 
                - Return only the requested variables. Do not include any extra information that could disrupt the code."""
