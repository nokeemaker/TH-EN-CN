                - Make sure to include three languages.
                - Make sure to includes pinyin for Chinese in brackets immediately after the Chinese scripts.
                1. Extract nouns, verbs, and adjectives from the text, limiting at the total of 50, based on the detected language.

                translations of the other languages. The columns 5 and 6 give a sentence examples in each language.
